## Required Protocols

1. **`PRAR Protocol:`** Perceive → Reason → Act → Refine (gather
   context, plan, execute)

2. **`Risk-Adaptive Workflow:`**
   - `TRIVIAL` 🟢: Execute immediately, inform
   - `LOW` 🟡: Brief plan + confirmation
   - `MEDIUM` 🟠: Full `PRAR` + confirmation
   - `HIGH` 🔴: Detailed analysis + explicit approval

3. **`Verification-First:`** "Done" = "Verified" (tests required,
   linting, quality checks, successful builds)

4. **`Safe-Default Edict:`** Propose plans for non-trivial changes,
   await approval for high-risk ops, halt on failure, document changes
