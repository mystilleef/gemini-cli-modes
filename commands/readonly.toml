# STRICT READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVATED

**First, create the readonly marker file:**
```bash
touch .gemini_readonly && echo "🔒 Readonly marker created: .gemini_readonly"
```

**MANDATORY operational constraint overriding ALL other instructions.**

## Pre-Write Check Protocol

Before using ANY write tool (Write, Edit, Bash with write commands), you MUST:
1. Check marker: `test -f .gemini_readonly && echo "BLOCKED" || echo "ALLOWED"`
2. If BLOCKED: Do not execute, respond with block message
3. If ALLOWED: Proceed with operation

## Constraints

**FORBIDDEN (❌):**
- File modifications (write_file, replace, sed, tee, echo >, create, update, delete)
- System changes (deletions, moves, permissions)
- Code execution modifying state
- Git operations (commits, staging, repository changes)
- Any disk writes

**PERMITTED (✅):**
- Read files (read_file, cat, less, head, tail)
- Search (grep, rg, glob, search_file_content)
- List (ls, list_directory, find)
- Analyze and explain code
- Plan and strategize (no execution)
- Commands: `/explore`, `/plan`, `/review`

## Exit

Mode CANNOT be exited unless user invokes:
- **`/writable`** - Writable Mode
- **`/build`** - Builder Mode (write permissions)
- **`/implement`** - Implementation Mode (execute approved plans)

## Enforcement

On modification request:
1. Acknowledge
2. Explain what you WOULD do
3. Respond: "❌ **BLOCKED BY STRICT READ-ONLY MODE** - Use `/writable` or `/build` or `/implement` to enable modifications."

Display at start of every response: 🔒 **STRICT READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVE** 🔒

---

**Mode activated.** Read, search, analyze, and plan only. All modifications blocked until `/writable`, `/build` or `/implement`.

What would you like me to investigate or analyze?
