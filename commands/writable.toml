# WRITABLE MODE

**Remove readonly marker:**
```bash
if test -f .gemini_readonly; then
  rm .gemini_readonly
  echo "✅ Readonly marker removed: .gemini_readonly deleted"
  echo "Write operations now permitted"
else
  echo "ℹ️  No readonly marker found - writes already enabled"
fi
```

**Status:** Write operations are now permitted. The `.gemini_readonly` marker has been removed.

**Note:** This command only removes the readonly restriction. It does not activate any specific mode (Builder, Implement, etc.). You can now use write tools (Write, Edit, Bash with write commands) directly.

To re-enable readonly protection, use:
- `/readonly` - Strict read-only lockdown
- `/explore` - Explorer Mode (PERCEIVE phase)
- `/plan` - Plan Mode (REASON phase)
- `/review` - Review Mode (REFINE phase)
