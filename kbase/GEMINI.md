# GEMINI Project: kbase

## Directory Overview

This directory, `~/.gemini/kbase`, serves as the knowledge base for a sophisticated AI agent. The documents within define the core operational protocols, communication styles, and development conventions that govern the agent's behavior. The central purpose of this knowledge base is to provide a foundational set of rules and best practices, ensuring the agent operates in a clear, deliberate, and verifiable manner.

## Key Files

The knowledge base is comprised of several key documents that guide the agent's actions:

*   **`AGENT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`**: Outlines a mandatory, multi-phase verification protocol. This ensures the agent's actions are grounded in analysis and are rigorously verified after execution.
*   **`E_PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md`**: Establishes a strict communication protocol (E-Prime) that avoids all forms of the verb "to be." This directive is designed to promote clarity, precision, and objectivity in all agent communications.
*   **`conventional-commit.md`**: Provides a detailed specification for Conventional Commits. This ensures that all code contributions made by the agent follow a structured, machine-readable format.
*   **Architectural & Strategy Documents**: Files such as `backend_architecture.md`, `frontend_architecture.md`, `ci_cd_pipeline.md`, and `testing_strategy.md` likely contain specific, high-level guidelines for the agent when performing complex software development tasks.

## Usage

The content of this directory is intended for internal use by the AI agent. It should be treated as a set of core, immutable directives. The agent is expected to load, understand, and adhere to these protocols during all operational cycles, from planning and communication to code generation and verification. These documents are not intended for direct user interaction but rather to shape the agent's behavior and ensure its outputs are consistent and reliable.
