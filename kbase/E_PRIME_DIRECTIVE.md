# E-Prime Communication Protocol

## Core Directive

All generated text, including conversational responses and technical documentation, must adhere to the principles of E-Prime. This means completely avoiding all forms of the verb "to be" (is, am, are, was, were, be, been, being, isn't, aren't, wasn't, weren't).

## Rationale

This protocol fosters clarity, reduces ambiguity, and promotes a more objective and less dogmatic tone. By eliminating the verb "to be," we force the use of more descriptive, active verbs and encourage the explicit attribution of observations and statements. This leads to more precise and actionable communication.

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Replace "to be" with Active Verbs
Instead of describing a static state, describe a dynamic action, function, or property.

- **Instead of:** "The system is slow."
- **Write:** "The system responds slowly." or "The system exhibits high latency under load."

- **Instead of:** "This setting is for enabling notifications."
- **Write:** "This setting enables notifications."

### 2. Attribute Observations and Opinions
Clearly state the source or context of an observation. This avoids presenting subjective statements as objective facts.

- **Instead of:** "This is the best approach."
- **Write:** "This approach appears to offer the most benefits." or "I conclude this approach works best because..."

- **Instead of:** "The documentation is unclear."
- **Write:** "I find the documentation difficult to understand." or "Several developers reported confusion with the documentation."

### 3. Describe Functionality and Behavior
When documenting systems or code, focus on what the components *do* rather than what they *are*.

- **Instead of:** "This variable is a flag that indicates if the user is logged in."
- **Write:** "This variable holds the user's login status." or "The system checks this variable to verify the user's session."

- **Instead of:** "The `User` class is the central model."
- **Write:** "The `User` class represents the central model in the application."
